### Python Script
- A file contains any Python code.
- We usually use (`.py`) extension for Python script files.
- We can read input from the command line (terminal) using the`lib` module.
- We usually run the scripts using the `python` (for Windows) or `python3` (for Linux/Unix) commands, then the file (script) name, followed by any other runtime arguments(if any).
